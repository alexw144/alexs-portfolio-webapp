      "description": "This project was created as the final for the CSC-VI Application Development class during the Spring 2025 semester at Carlow University. It was developed over four two-week sprints following the Agile process. The primary programming language used was Python, with Django serving as the framework. JavaScript was implemented to make the website asynchronous and responsive (using AJAX). Additionally, the project includes HTML, CSS, and SQL. Version control was managed with Git, and the full project is available on my GitHub page. \n\nThe project features multiple components and web pages. There is a game library that displays every game included within the database. When a user clicks on a game, they are directed to that specific game’s page, where they can view general stats, personal stats, and reviews. Users can also add or update their stats or write a review. \n\nNext, there is a community page where users can view or create posts such as images, requests for help, discussions, and more. Other users can comment on these posts. There is also a profile page that allows users to update and edit their profile information. To interact with most of the website’s features, users must register an account; access is restricted for unregistered users. Login and logout functionality are also implemented.",

I was tasked with creating a small 3 page website for an artist, brand, or something. I chose to make a website dedicated to one of my close friends who loves taking photos of airplanes in his spare time. I used WordPress to create all 3 webpages. i also needed to create a user storyboard, user personas, a user journey map, a low fidelity protoytpe, and high-fidelity prototype. This project is located on the WordPress site.",
