        <p>
          I am a web developer, located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I
          paved the way as one of the first students to graduate from Carlow
          University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I even had
          the opportunity to create important webpages while interning with
          Carlow University's marketing team. I hope to one day become a
          full-stack developer, but for now, I am looking to jumpstart my career. You can catch me creating new websites, going out with my friends, studying Japanese, and more.
